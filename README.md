# Goldbach Decomposition using Bitmap Sieve of Erastosthenes

Goldbach's conjecture:
"Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes."


This C program expects a number as input once it is open. For example, giving it 100 will mean it will calculate all prime numbers >= 100 using a Sieve of Erastosthenes implemented using a bitmap.


Then, it can be queried for the decomposition of any even number less than the original input.
